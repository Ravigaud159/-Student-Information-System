Student-Information-System

I created an AWT project called 'Student Information System' using C# in the .NET framework on the Visual Studio platform, utilizing SQL database and master pages with web forms. The project includes a registration or login page where users can enter student information such as name, age, class, and email. After adding the information, users can view the stored data.
